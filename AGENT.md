## Overview

- This repository contains code that we will be using to estimate number of cases of a disease based on the number of genetic variants observed.
- The number of genetic variants will be extracted from phylogenetic trees in formats as Newick or Nexus.
- The code is written in Python using poetry for dependency management.
