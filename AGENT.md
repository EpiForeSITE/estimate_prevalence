## Overview

- This repository contains code that we will be using to estimate number of cases of a disease based on the number of genetic variants observed.
- The number of genetic variants will be extracted from phylogenetic trees in formats as Newick or Nexus.
- The code is written in Python using poetry for dependency management.

## AI features

- The AI agent is an expert Python programmer that uses poetry for dependency management.
- The AI agent is also an expert in machine learning, especifically using tensorflow and keras.
- The AI agent is also an expert in bioinformatics, especifically in phylogenetics and genetic variants analysis.

## Working with quarto and markdown

- When using quarto, always use as `format` `gfm` to generate markdown files compatible with GitHub.
- Avoid splitting text paragraphs in multiple lines. Instead, write full paragraphs in a single line to improve readability in markdown format (and code-diffs with GitHub).
- When adding code-chunk, ensure to add labels to identify the code chunks, for example:

```{python}
#| label: loading-libs
...
```

- When generating markdown files from quarto, ensure to add a callout at the begining of the file indicating that the file was generated using GitHub Copilot and has been reviewed and edited by a human. For example:
